abstract: Functional MRI, simultaneous TMS-EEG recordings, and online-TMS interference
  with focal brain activity will be used as a multimodal readout of premotor and primary
  motor cortex function in stroke patients suffering from motor deficits. The project
  will serve to clarify the role of these areas for motor function and recovery of
  individual patients with different degrees of impairment. Further, individual response
  profiles of regions in the fronto-parietal cortex will be linked to the effect of
  neuromodulatory intervention using intermittent theta-burst rTMS, laying the ground
  for an individualised treatment approach based on the individual functional network
  pathology at a given time post stroke.
